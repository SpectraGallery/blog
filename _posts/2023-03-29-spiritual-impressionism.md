Spiritual arts encompass various practices and traditions aimed at promoting spiritual growth, personal transformation, and connection to the divine. These practices may include forms of mindfulness, movement, and expression. Spiritual impressionism, in particular, focuses on the practice of impressionism and symbolism - an art movement that emerged in France in the late 19th century. This art form is characterised by its emphasis on capturing the fleeting effects of light and colour in nature, and using symbols to represent abstract concepts, including emotions, feelings, and ideas.


My intention of proposing this new art form is to create a mystical means of communication that deepens one's connection to a higher, inaccessible reality, helps in gaining a greater understanding of oneself and others, and cultivates a sense of inner peace and well-being. Such experience goes beyond the physical world and is associated with one's spirituality. Hence, the concept is for a new experiment that should plan a general playground for various mindsets.

 
Many spiritual arts have roots in ancient mystical and religious traditions and have been practiced for centuries or even millennia. They can be used in both personal and communal settings and may be taught by spiritual teachers, mentors, or practitioners. The information contained in traditional art forms can be a powerful tool for personal growth and transformation and can help individuals to cultivate a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in their lives. Meanwhile, ancient spiritual communications contain elements that may seem ambiguous, primitive or esoteric to modern sensibilities. While I am fully noticing that many existing means have been found to be effective by countless generations of practitioners, I decided to stick to the practices of spiritualising impressionism and symbolism for these practices, in my opinion, easily resonate with modern, creative mindset and aesthetics.


While spiritual exercises often involve specific practices or rituals such as meditation, prayer, or yoga, spiritual impressionism emphasises a different type of cogitation through the creation of art and the experience of aesthetic beauty. Spiritual impressionism aims to evoke spiritual experiences and emotions through the use of imagery, colour, and composition. The contents of the image can play as a mirror to cultivate a receptive state of mind. One of the most important things to do when seeking spiritual communication is to cultivate a receptive state of mind. This can be achieved through expressive brushstrokes, vibrant colours, and symbolic imagery that help to quiet the mind and open up space for spiritual insights and messages. In addition, the pieces of artwork will diffuse the insights and messages to gather different viewers to listen to an outer voice, perceive outer guidance, and establish spiritual communication with the creator of the pieces.


It is true that establishing spiritual communication can be a deeply personal and individual journey, and the methods that work best can vary from person to person. However, here are some general tips that may help artists contribute to spiritual impressionism.


- The primary focus of spiritual impressionism is on the creation of art that evokes a sense of awe, wonder, and transcendence in the viewer. The artistic form is designed to cultivate specific spiritual states or experiences.
- Spiritual impressionism aims to create an emotional impact on the viewer, evoking feelings of connection, caring for the emotional responses of the viewer, and developing resonating states such as compassion, mindfulness, or equanimity with the creators.
- Spiritual impressionism aims at creative expression, allowing artists to express their spiritual beliefs and experiences through the medium of art. This is different from many spiritual exercises, which may be more focused on following specific traditions or teachings.
- Spiritual impressionism looks for the potential to appeal to a wide range of viewers, regardless of their spiritual beliefs or practices. This is different from many spiritual exercises, which may be more specific to certain religious or philosophical traditions.


Apart from the general tips, I have some personal ideas. I believe that by setting aside a regular number of works for a specific spiritual theme, the artists can be easier to establish spiritual communication with their audience over that theme, just like dedicating time to spiritual practice that helps one connect with others, probably even the higher beings. Consistency is key. Being mindful and present at the moment to communicate with fellows in this community can also help the artists to become more aware of the spiritual energies around us. Practice being fully present in this activity, and try to stay aware of the thoughts and feelings that arise. Spending time together could be a powerful way to connect with a spiritual unity. Take a walk in the woods together, sit by a stream or river, or spend time in a garden or park. Take time to observe the beauty and stillness of the natural and the human world around us. All of these would be useful to create a piece of artwork of spiritual impressionism.


In addition, to assist the viewers to experience the theme of spiritual ecstasy and transcendence, I would think of one or more of the following themes and compositions:

- the balance between opposing forces
- recursive or circular designs representing wholeness and unity
- polyptych or a series of paintings that depict different aspects of experiences, feelings, and perspectives.
- use of dynamic, expressive media and forms to suggest the conscious and unconscious transformation in the spiritual states.


Overall, I would define spiritual impressionism as an artistic genre that merges the spiritual realm with the (post-)impressionist movement. It seeks to express the intangible aspects of the human experience through the use of expressive brushstrokes, vibrant colours, and symbolic imagery. It explores the mystical aspects of life, aiming to capture the essence of spirituality and transcendence in its artwork. Spiritual impressionism invites the viewer to connect with the painter and, together, seek a deeper understanding of the human condition and the dynamical world around us, creating a powerful and meaningful experience for those who engage with it.
