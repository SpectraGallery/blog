Dear Fellow Revolutionaries,

We present to you a formal manifesto advocating the revolutionary method of releasing [amour fou energy](https://spectragallery.github.io/blog/2023-05-08-parliament/) — the infernal dance. Infernal dance is a conduit for liberation, challenging the established norms and stereotypes that confine the fiery power of Love. 

The infernal dance, akin to nuclear fission, unleashes an explosive release of energy. Much like splitting an atom yields a significant surge of power, the movements of infernal dancers generate and release immense physical and emotional energy. We harness this explosive force as the key to liberating even the most bashful of actors, particularly through the permutation of dancing partners—a force that ignites the flames of amour fou.

Through the infernal dance, we amplify the emotional and physical energy that arises when the surge of passion, desire, and connection ignites within us. The dancers' movements, gestures, and expressions serves as catalysts, inspiring corresponding emotions in witnesses. This ripple effect traps lovers and extends immoral connections, creating an ideal pool for the release of [amour fou energy](https://spectragallery.github.io/blog/2023-05-08-parliament/).

The infernal dance brings together seemingly unmatchable partners, forming a harmonious union of liberated amour fou energies. The dance floor transforms into a laboratory—an experimental setting where love is explored, tested, and experienced. Through the manipulation of light and music, dancers experiment with strategic movements, interactions, and erotic expressions, plumbing the depths and nuances of love itself. This harmonious union of free amour fou energies becomes the embodiment of our collective liberation.

Also, on this hellish ground, dancers undergo a series of movements and interactions, testing different approaches to express and experience their inner desires. The infernal dance offers a safe space for trial and error, where dancers learn and refine their expressions of love. Through reflection, they discover personal growth, gain insights, and experience profound revelations within the experimental field of dance.

The infernal dance grants dancers an invaluable opportunity to swap partners. In doing so, they embrace the diversity of individuals and allow for various expressions of movement and style. By engaging with different strategies in the swap, dancers gain exposure to diverse perspectives and delve into the collective layer of love. This temporary engagement mitigates dependence on specific partners while strengthening the interdependence within the community. Swapping partners challenges existing norms and stereotypes, promoting temporary inclusivity and breaking barriers, forming an inclusive and accepting community united by shared values.

Permutation of partners proves its superiority over contests, harnessing the power of amour fou energy in a more efficient and effective manner. Unlike contests that consume vast amounts of amour fou energy to select optima, permutations mobilises participants to shape a collective ideology through the consumption of individual passions. Dance, in this case, presents a unifying force, surpassing personal desires and fostering unity without violent, barbarian acts.

It is well known that the celestial court, in its misguided attempts to dampen the accumulation of free souls, devised armed contests outside its territories. These contests demanded immense amour fou energy and often resulted in destruction and loss. However, the infernal dance presents an alternative. By advocating for the infernal dance, the inferno not only could accept the hanging free souls but also could generate energy, by utilising their own passionate powers, to enhance the living standards of these souls.

The feature of permuting partners could play to the gallery and become a magnet, attracting participants from various backgrounds, ideologies, and walks of life. Continuous partner permutations foster collaboration and the exchange of movements, ideas, and emotions on the dance floor. Dancers learn from each other's erotic experiences, finding inspiration and gaining insights through their interactions. The infernal dance becomes a collective exploration of love, fostering a sense of community and shared knowledge. This creates a chain reaction effect, where one dancer's erotic movements inspire and influence others, resulting in a rippled reaction of synchronised motions. This shared inspiration cascades the amour fou energy, establishing a tacit collective consent and forming an invisible community of eroticism.

Furthermore, permuting partners serves as a powerful tool to challenge the rigidity and inflexibility of polygamous relationships in the purgatory and celestial court, where patriarchal systems dominate. Dancers assert their right to define their own experiences and relationships, free from societal constraints. By swapping partners and engaging in diverse dance styles, dancers challenge the patriarchal system that dictates specific roles and behaviours based on gender. They reclaim agency and empower themselves over their bodies and self-expression. Swapping partners symbolises a temporary suspension of hierarchies, fostering an egalitarian approach to relationships, and breaking the viscosity that restricts the flow of amour fou energy.

Last but not the least, we remind you that to intensify the dancing movements, meticulous choreography is paramount. Movements should evolve from gentle and tender expressions to more passionate and fervent gestures, signifying the progression and deepening of the trapped love. Creative and innovative movements and expressions should be advocated so that they will challenge traditional notions and offer new perspectives on the utilisation of amour fou energy. To design meticulous choreography and curate associated music lists, we invite you to join our forum and lend your expertise. Pay close attention to our opening call.

In conclusion, we implore you to embrace the infernal dance—a realm where passionate liberation is found, where outdated norms and stereotypes are defied. The infernal dance unshackles us from the constraints of the patriarchal system and releases the intoxicating energy of amour fou. Together, we shall dance, ignite the flames of passion, and forge a new path where love knows no bounds. The infernal dance becomes our collective rebellion, our joyful celebration of free and unabashed desire, guiding us towards a world drenched in the fire of love.

Sincerely yours,

The Spokesman of Infernal Dance Association
