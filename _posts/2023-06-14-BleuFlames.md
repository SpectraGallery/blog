Proposal for Implementing Incomplete Combustion with Methane in the eastern Inferno

Dear Honourable members of the House of Immortals and distinguished representatives from the House of Commons,

I am presenting you a proposal for the implementation of incomplete combustion, specifically driven by methane, in the Inferno project. The purpose of this proposal is to introduce a symbolic representation of blue flames, reminiscent of complete combustion seen in heavenâ€™s flames, while utilising an illusionary incomplete approach to achieve the desired effect.

Rationale:

The concept of blue flames, traditionally associated with complete combustion in heavenly realms, has established a powerful symbolic identity. In celestial domains, blue flames symbolise the highest stages of spiritual attainment and the union of opposites. It also associates with angelic energies for healing, protection or purification. 

However, with the presence of methane (CH4), our team has not only succeeded in altering the ubiquitous yellow-red colour of the infernal flames but also falsified the blue hue by exciting some special agents in the combustion process. Contrary to traditional blue flames, this new variation does not necessitate complete combustion or high temperatures, nor does it require the same level of purity.

The research team has also discovered that by incorporating incomplete combustion through methane-driven blue flames, aptly named "bleu flames," we can fire up the symbolic influence while avoiding any deep sense of interconnectedness that transcends physical desires. The proposed symbolism intends to represent the transformation of energies associated with human erotic passions and unconventional relationships with the false objects and subjects, aligning with the overarching [amour fou theme](https://spectragallery.github.io/blog/2023-05-08-parliament/) explored in the eastern Inferno.

Symbolic Interpretation:

1. Methane as the Catalyst: Methane (CH4), composed of carbon and hydrogen, symbolises the fundamental experience and knowledge of life itself. Carbon signifies the materialistic and greedy aspects of human existence, while hydrogen represents fragmented spirits yearning for transformation and redemption.
2. Bleu Flames as Amour Fou Energy: The blue flames resulting from incomplete methane combustion symbolise an intense and transformative energy within the Inferno. They attempt to simulate a similar process of love as complete combustion in heaven but solely for the purpose of "amour fou." These flames trigger the passionate and irrational elements of crazy relationships and fallacious beliefs that drive individuals to extreme behaviours. 


Implementation Approach:

The combustion process commences with the ignition of methane in the presence of special agents, usually referred to as O2 agents, capable of accepting negativities from others during the chemical reaction. These agents are highly reactive and, upon contact with methane, generate sufficient amount of heat to initiate the reaction. As methane and O2 agents interact, existing bonds break, and new complex affairs form. As the methane-O2 reaction progresses, a bleu flame emerges when these complex affairs synthesise into a partial relationship, yielding a group of toxic monomania agents as primary combustion byproducts. It is important to note that the flames do not require high temperature or complete combustion as seen in the holy process of heaven. Although toxic, the mono agents can be repurposed as reducing agents in other missions, such as intermediates in the synthesis of alcohols, metallurgy, smelting or fuel gas in kilns, among others.

Remarks:

To achieve the desired effect, the implementation must employ illusionary techniques that recreates the appearance of bleu flames while adhering to the drafted [Amour Fou Law](https://spectragallery.github.io/blog/2023-05-08-parliament/). Safety measures for the participants and the environment should be paramount. Special effects equipment, such as carefully designed lighting, projections, and visual effects, should be utilised to create immersive experience for participants, evoking the symbolic presence of bleu flames throughout their erotic experiences.

Furthermore, artistic representations and narrative elements should be incorporated to contextualise the symbolism of methane-driven blue flames, allowing participants to engage with and reflect upon the metaphorical dimensions of their own emotions and desires.

Project Timeline and Budget:

Our team will meticulously craft a detailed project timeline and budget plan to outline the necessary resources, (wo)manpower, and timeline required for the implementation of incomplete combustion using methane-driven blue flames within the Inferno. This comprehensive plan will ensure a seamless integration of the symbolic representation while adhering to safety guidelines and achieving the desired artistic impact.

To delve deeply into the transformative potential of methane within the Inferno, we recognise the need for an extensive architectural approach that enables utilisation and circulation of methane on a larger scale. As methane is often extracted from raw materials or waste sources, followed by a process of distillation or purification, the construction of a global waste source processor using Treatment and Optimisation of Integrated Low Emission Technology (T.O.I.L.E.T) will meet this purpose. This state-of-the-art processor will facilitate the accumulation and compression of methane through a carefully designed routine and redirection of methane flow. By maximising the utility of flow energy through various stages of metamorphosis, the T.O.I.L.E.T. will serve as the focal point for popularising the concept of bleu flames. Securing special budget approval for the global waste source processor will be essential to realise this vision.

Conclusion:

Implementing incomplete combustion with methane-driven blue flames in the Inferno project offers a unique opportunity to explore the symbolic misappropriation. The proposed symbolism, driven by methane's representation of carbon and hydrogen, aims to stimulate fallacious desires and encourage participants to navigate intricate complexities. 

With the mesmerizing bleu flames at our disposal, we harness the power of methane to signify the birth of a new inferno. This groundbreaking approach to incomplete combustion not only pushes artistic boundaries but also propels us towards revolutionary advancements in sustainable waste management.

We look forward to discussing this proposal further and exploring the possibilities of incorporating bleu flames within the Inferno project. Thank you for considering the proposal.
