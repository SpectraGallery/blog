Proposal for Implementing Incomplete Combustion with Methane in the Inferno

Dear Honourable members of the House of Immortals and distinguished representatives from the House of Commons,

I am presenting you a proposal for the implementation of incomplete combustion, specifically driven by methane, in the Inferno project. The purpose of this proposal is to introduce a symbolic representation of blue flames, reminiscent of complete combustion seen in heaven’s flames, while utilising an illusionary incomplete approach to achieve the desired effect.

Rationale:

The concept of blue flames, traditionally associated with complete combustion in heavenly realms, has established a powerful symbolic identity. In heaven, blue flames symbolise the highest stages of spiritual attainment and the union of opposites. It also associates with angelic energies for healing, protection or purification. 

However, with the presence of methane (CH4), our team have not only alter the ubiquitous yellow-red colour of the infernal flames but also falsified the blue hue by exciting some special agents in the combustion process. For such blue flames, we don’t need complete combustion nor high temperature, not even say the purity.

The research team has also discovered that by incorporating incomplete combustion through methane-driven blue flames, what we call bleu flames, we can fire up the symbolic influence while avoiding any deep sense of interconnectedness that transcends physical desires. The proposed symbolism intends to represent the transformation of energies associated with human erotic passions and unconventional relationships with the false objects and subjects, aligning them with the [amour fou theme](https://spectragallery.github.io/blog/2023-05-08-parliament/) explored in the eastern Inferno.

Symbolic Interpretation:

1. Methane as the Catalyst: Methane (CH4), composed of carbon and hydrogen, symbolises the fundamental experience or knowledge of life. Carbon signifies the materialistic and greedy aspects of human existence, while hydrogen represents fragmented spirits yearning for transformation and redemption. 
2. Bleu Flames as Amour Fou Energy: The blue flames resulting from incomplete methane combustion will symbolise an intense and transformative energy within the Inferno. It attempts to simulate similar love process as the complete combustion in heaven but only associates with « amour fou » purpose, triggering the passionate and irrational aspects of crazy relationships and fallacious believes that drive individuals to extreme behaviours.  
Implementation Approach:

The combustion process begins with the ignition of methane in the presence of special agents who have the ability to accept negativities from others during the chemical reaction, usually we call them O2 agents. They are highly reactive. When methane meet these agents, a sufficient amount of heat can initiate the reaction. Members with methane react with O2 agents, resulting in the breaking of existing bonds and the formation of new complex affairs. As the methane-O2 reaction progresses, a bleu flame emerges when the complex affairs synthesise into a partial relationship, resulting in the formation of the primary combustion byproducts, a group of toxic monomania agents. Note that the flames do not need high temperature neither complete combustion required in the holy process in heaven. The mono agents although toxic could be reused as reducing agents in other missions, such as intermediates in the synthesis of alcohols, metallurgy, smelting or fuel gas in kilns, etc..

Remarks:

To achieve the desired effect, the implementation should involve an illusionary technique that recreates the appearance of bleu flames while ensuring to follow the drafted [Amour Fou Law](https://spectragallery.github.io/blog/2023-05-08-parliament/). The implementation should take care of the safety of the participants and the environment. Special effects equipment, such as carefully designed lighting, projections, and visual effects, should be utilised to create an immersive experience for participants, evoking the symbolic presence of bleu flames throughout their erotic experiences.

Furthermore, artistic representations and narrative elements will be incorporated to contextualise the symbolism of methane-driven blue flames, allowing participants to engage with and reflect upon the metaphorical dimensions of their own emotions and desires.

Project Timeline and Budget:

We plan to draft a detailed project timeline and budget plan, which will outline the necessary resources, (wo)manpower, and timeline required for the implementation of incomplete combustion using methane-driven blue flames within the Inferno. This plan will ensure a seamless integration of the symbolism while adhering to safety guidelines and achieving the desired artistic impact.

In order to deeply explore the transformative potential of methane within the Inferno, the project may need a comprehensive architectural approach that ensure utilisation and circulation of methane in an extensive scale. As methane is often extracted from raw materials or waste sources, followed by a process of distillation or purification, the construction of a global waste source processor using Treatment and Optimisation of Integrated Low Emission Technology (T.O.I.L.E.T) may meet this purpose. The processor would let methane undergo a series of accumulation and compression steps and will carefully design the routine and redirection of methane flow so that it can maximise the utility of the flow energy through different stages of metamorphosis. The global waste source processor will be the focal point of popularise the bleu flames and needs special budget approval.

Conclusion:

Implementing incomplete combustion with methane-driven blue flames in the Inferno project offers a unique opportunity to explore the symbolic misappropriation. The proposed symbolism, driven by methane's representation of carbon and hydrogen, aims to stimulate fallacious desires and encourage participants to experience different complexities. 

With bleu flames, we will harness the power of methane to create mesmerising blue flames that signify the dawn of a new inferno. The incomplete combustion will ignite a revolutionary leap towards sustainable waste management. We look forward to discussing this proposal further and exploring the possibilities of incorporating bleu flames within the Inferno project. Thank you for considering the proposal.
