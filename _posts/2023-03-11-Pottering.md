The project intends to represent different spiritual forces, meanwhile blurting the existing boundaries of these forces, making them part of the concrescence. I am experimenting with gestural representations, identifying the commonalities and differences between the forces through symbolism and cultural significance. Everything flows from one to another, creating unusual forms that can be both people and spirits simultaneously. The project also aims to deliver a sense of transcendence that might have spiritual sustenance relating to personal feelings toward the forces, the phenomena created by the forces, or the imaginary outcomes.


My creative goals are to inspire those who view my work to connect, reconnect and create what arises within. I hope to invite the viewer to notice the subtlety in dynamic layering of texture and colour in contrast with the playful brush strokes and lines. I hope to challenge the viewer to go deep within to attune to the experience of the senses and notice a mindful shift in perspective.
